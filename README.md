##StartScreen

StartScreen is a small Clientside page that aims to provide a quick and efficient way to search for
content and place favorites.

StartScreen is built with HTML5 + CSS3 and JavaScript. It does not need to run on a Server. While it
doesen't need to run on a webserver, it can be run on one to make it available from everywhere.

##Why

Most browsers nowadays come with some kind of Start page or speed-dial system. These are convenient, but
not really all that customisable. StartScreen is a customizable Homepage that provides rich and useful
functionality to guide the user to the content he desires.
