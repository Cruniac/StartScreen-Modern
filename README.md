StartScreen
===========

This is a small personal Start Screen for a Webbrowser.

The Site is implemented in HTML, CSS and Javascript only, so it doesen't need to run on a Webserver.

This Start Screen supports the following features:
* Does not need a Webserver
* Favourites list with categories
* Support for Google CSE (Custom Search Engine)

This Startscreen is customised with some of the Websites I frequent.
If you want to change them, then you can do so in the index.html file.

##License
* The content made by myself is licensed under the GPLv2 license.
* Google and the Google CSE Engine are trademarks of Google Inc.

##Thanks to
* Random poster on 4chan that gave me some inspiration on the site
* Google for providing their CSE Engine

##Todo
* [DONE] Use the CSE API instead of Google's Script to get better integration going.
* Offer Duckduckgo alternative for searching the web.
* Offer a Light version of the site that can be toggled on and off.
