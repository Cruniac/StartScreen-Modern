##StartScreen


This is a small personal Start Screen for a Webbrowser.

The Site is implemented in HTML, CSS and Javascript only, so it doesen't need to run on a Webserver.

This Start Screen supports the following features:
* Does not need a Webserver
* Favourites list with categories
* Support for Google CSE (Custom Search Engine)

This Startscreen is customised with some of the Websites I frequent.
If you want to change them, then you can do so in the index.html file.
